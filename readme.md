# Emotion Detector

Welcome to the Face Emotion Detector repository! This project contains code for detecting emotions using a camera. The repository is structured with different scripts for emotion detection, accessing a mobile camera, and combining both functionalities.

## Repository Structure

- **emotion_detector.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for detecting emotions. It uses pre-trained models to identify and classify emotions from facial expressions in images.

- **mobcam_accessing.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook includes code for accessing the mobile camera. It sets up the mobile device as a camera source to capture real-time video feed.

- **mobip.py**: This script integrates the emotion detection functionality with the mobile camera access. It captures real-time video from the mobile camera and performs emotion detection on the live feed.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detector.git
   cd emotion-detector
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   Make sure you have Python and Jupyter installed. Install the necessary libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebooks:**
   Open Jupyter Notebook in your terminal and navigate to the `emotion_detector.ipynb` or `mobcam_accessing.ipynb` file to run the code.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. **Run the integrated script:**
   To run the combined emotion detector using the mobile camera, execute:
   ```bash
   python mobip.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Emotion Detection:**
   Open and run `emotion_detector.ipynb` to test the emotion detection on sample images.

2. **Mobile Camera Access:**
   Open and run `mobcam_accessing.ipynb` to access and test the mobile camera functionality.

3. **Real-time Emotion Detection using Mobile Camera:**
   Run `mobip.py` to start capturing real-time video from the mobile camera and perform emotion detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Other libraries as specified in `requirements.txt`

## Notes

- Ensure your mobile device and computer are connected to the same network if you're accessing the mobile camera.
- Modify the IP address in the code if necessary to match your mobile device's IP.
